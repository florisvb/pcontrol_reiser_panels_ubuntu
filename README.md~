udev rule for panel controller
===

1. Plug in your panels controller
2. Type dmesg into the terminal, and find the serial number of your controller
3. Edit 99-panels_controller.rules to reflect that serial number
4. Move 99-panels_controller.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d (requires sudo)

The rule assigns a symbolic link '/dev/ttyS101' to the controller. When starting PControl, enter '101' as the serial port number

What I changed
===

Some files may not yet be hacked, but these steps should fix any offending files:

1. replace '\' with '/'
2. remove ':' when associated with a disk name
3. replace 'del' with 'rm', and 'copy' with 'cp', and use '-r' instead of '/Q' or '/Y'
4. replace 'dos' with 'system' (only necessary in some files)
5. ubuntu is case sensitive.. some files may need to be renamed, or the calls to them be changed to match the case sensitive name
